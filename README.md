# Design for All
**A Typographic & Interactive Exploration of Inclusivity**

> *"Every time you victimized someone, you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself." — The Egg, by Andy Weir.*

## 1. Project Overview
**Design for All** is a responsive web project that explores the boundaries of web typography and interaction without the reliance on JavaScript. It is a manifesto of inclusivity, open-source thinking, and cross-media adaptability.

Built strictly with **HTML & CSS**, this project demonstrates how fundamental web technologies can be pushed to create immersive, animated, and functional user experiences.

## 2. Design Concepts
The visual and conceptual foundation of this website rests on two main pillars:

### 🥚 The "Egg" Theory
Inspired by Andy Weir’s short story *"The Egg"*, the site embraces the philosophy of **Great Unity ("Datong")** and radical empathy. The content mirrors the story’s realization that we are all one consciousness experiencing life in different forms. This translates into three core design principles:
1.  **Inclusivity:** Design is not for a select few; it is for everyone.
2.  **Open Source:** Design thinking should be shared, accessible, and evolved by "every thinker."
3.  **Fluidity:** Just as the protagonist in the story transcends time and lives, a designer should transcend media constraints.

### 💊 Visual Identity: Shapes of Inclusion
To visualize the concept of "embracing differences," the UI juxtaposes **Pill Shapes** (soft, organic) with **Rectangles** (structured, rigid).
* **Symbolism:** This contrast represents the harmony between different ideologies and people.
* **Typography:** The display font was specifically chosen for its eclectic mix of geometric forms, reinforcing the theme of a composite, multifaceted unity.

## 3. Curated Content
The site features three selected articles that serve as the theoretical backbone of the project, each corresponding to a core design principle:

### I. On Inclusivity
**"I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me."**
* **Author:** Don Norman (2019)
* **Theme:** This article challenges the design community to return to true usability. It reflects the site's commitment to **"Design for All,"** arguing that complexity shouldn't alienate the elderly or the non-tech-savvy.

### II. On Democratization
**"In Defense of Design Thinking, Which Is Terrible"**
* **Author:** Khoi Vinh (2018)
* **Theme:** Addressing the criticism and hype around design thinking, this piece advocates for the democratization of the creative process. It aligns with the concept that design thinking should be **Open Source** and accessible to "every thinker," not just professionals.

### III. On Fluidity
**"Designing in the Borderlands"**
* **Author:** Frank Chimero (2014)
* **Theme:** Chimero explores the blurry edges between web, print, and digital screens.

## 4. Technical Implementation
This project was built under strict technical constraints to challenge the limits of modern CSS.

### The Constraints
* **No JavaScript** allowed.
* **HTML & CSS** Only.
* Maximum of **one** external image file.
* Inline SVGs.

### Key Features & Techniques
* **Responsive Layout:** Built with a robust combination of **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
* **Scroll-Driven Animations:** Implemented purely with CSS to create dynamic storytelling as the user scrolls.
* **CSS-Only Interactivity:** Dropdown menus and toggles achieved via the `label` + `input` (Checkbox/Radio) hack.
* **Advanced Typography:** Utilized the `text-box` (text-box-trim) property for precise vertical alignment.
* **Scalable Graphics:** Extensive use of CSS-controlled Inline SVGs for lightweight, crisp visuals.
